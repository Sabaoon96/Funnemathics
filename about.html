<h1>Welcome</h1>
<hr>
Thank you for visiting the website. I am Shah Raza and would like to welcome you - the parents as well as the students, to take a few moments out and go through what I have to offer.<br><br>
I am a qualified secondary mathematics teacher registered with the New Zealand Teachers Council. I have been teaching ever since 1996 and have expertise in Math curriculum of Cambridge, NCEA, IB, SAT and GMAT. Students with me have performed beyond their expectations. Many have gone on to get A*s, distinctions, excellences and merits.<br><br>
Students have the freedom to decide the setting they are comfortable with. Classes are tailored as per their needs. They get the focused attention they require and are allowed their own pace. The understanding, confidence, encouragement and motivation they get after taking up even a few sessions with me is truly reflected in their approach toward different tasks/work assignments.<br><br>
I believe in building relationships - students and their parents stay in touch even after the completion of their studies.<br><br>
Feedback is given on a fortnightly basis to parents.<br><br>
So I promise that I can make the difference!
